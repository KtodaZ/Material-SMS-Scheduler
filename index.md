# Material SMS Scheduler
A class project that quickly turned into an obsession and public android app. 
This project has solidified my knowledge of Java and OOP, showed me the results of good and bad design design, and has helped me learn the Android ecosystem as well as features like SQLite, implementing and modifying 3rd party libraries, and much, much more.
